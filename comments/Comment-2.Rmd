# Things to discuss and change in the manuscript

## About `eta`, `kappa`, $\eta$ and $\kappa$

Change all `eta` to `kappa` in the visible code and plots

## On the construction of $\Sigma$

Refer to the `simrel-m` paper and make clear that latent covariance between $z$ and $w$ has one row with 4 non-zero values and all the rest are zero. In the mathematics, the reviewer has given, it is no $1_4^t$ but $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}^t$.

This also should settle the third comment.

## On the basis of comparison

If we use $(X^tX)$ as a weight matrix, the result will highly similar to prediction error which we have already explored in previous paper. In many designs with high multicollinearity, the estimation and prediction error perform differently which is the part we want to explore in this paper.
