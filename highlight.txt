Highlights:

- A comparative performance study of the estimation of multivariate linear regression methods in multi-response models
- Method which have shown best performance in prediction should also be observed carefully while using their estimations
- Methods based on envelopes have large estimation variation for non-optimal number of dimension but can give fine result for optimal one.
- Demonstrates how different methods gives low prediction error even when their estimation is poor.
