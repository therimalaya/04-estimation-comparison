High error in estimation not necessarily results in high prediction error but can lead to an unreliable prediction when test data are in a different direction than the training data. In addition, the effect of a variable becomes unstable and can not be interpreted in such situations. Many research fields are more interested in these estimates than performing prediction. This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and well-established (PCR, PLS) estimation methods using simulated data with specifically designed properties such as multicollinearity, the correlation between multiple responses and position of principal components of predictors that are relevant for the response. This study aims to give some insights into these methods and help the researchers to understand and use them for further study. Write some specifics from the results to show what we have found. Introduction Estimation of parameters in a regression model is an integral part of many research study. Research fields such as social science, econometrics, psychology and medical study are more interested in measuring the impact of certain indicator or variable rather than performing prediction. Such studies have a large influence on people’s perception and also help in policy making and decisions. Technology has facilitated researcher to collect a large amount of data however often times, such data either contains irrelevant information or are highly collinear. Researchers are devising new estimators to extract information and identify their inter-relationship. Some estimators are robust towards fixing the multicollinearity problem while some are targeted to model only the relevant information contained in the response variable. This study extends the (Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø 2019) and compares some well-established estimators such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares (PLS) together with two new methods based on envelope estimation: Envelope estimation in predictor space (Xenv) (Cook, Li, and Chiaromonte 2010) and simultaneous estimation of envelope (Senv) (Cook and Zhang 2015). The estimation process of these methods is discussed in [Methods] section. The comparison tests the estimation performance of these methods using multi-response simulated data from a linear model with controlled properties. The properties include the number of predictors, level of multicollinearity, the correlation between different response variables and the position of relevant predictor components. These properties are explained in Experimental Design section together with the strategy behind the simulation and data model. "],
["simulation-model.html", "Simulation Model", " Simulation Model As a follow-up, this study will continue using the same simulation model used by Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019). The data is simulated from a multivariate normal distribution where we assume that the variation in response variable y is partly explained by the predictor variable \\(x\\). However, in many situations, only a subspace of the predictor space is relevant for the variation in the response \\(y\\). This space can be referred to as the relevant space of \\(x\\) and the rest as irrelevant space. In a similar way, for a certain model, we can assume that a subspace in the response space exists and contains the information that the relevant space in predictor can explain (Figure 1). Figure 1: Relevant space in a regression model Following the concept of relevant space, a subset of predictor components can be imagined to span the predictor space. These components can be regarded as relevant predictor components. Naes and Martens (1985) introduced the concept of relevant components which was explored further by Helland (1990), Næs and Helland (1993), Helland and Almøy (1994) and Helland (2000). The corresponding eigenvectors were referred to as relevant eigenvectors. A similar logic is introduced by Cook, Li, and Chiaromonte (2010) and later by Cook, Helland, and Su (2013) as an envelope which is the space spanned by the relevant eigenvectors (Cook 2018, , p.101). See Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2018), Sæbø, Almøy, and Helland (2015) and Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019) for in-depth background on the model. "],

["experimental-design.html", "Experimental Design", " Experimental Design An R (R Core Team 2018) package simrel (Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø 2018; Sæbø, Almøy, and Helland 2015) is used to simulate the data for comparison. In the simulation the number of observation is fixed at \\(n = 100\\) and following four simulation parameters are used to obtain the data with wide range of properties. Number of predictors: In order to cover both tall \\((n&gt;p)\\) and wide \\((p&gt;n)\\) cases, \\(p=20\\) and \\(p=250\\) number of predictors are simulated. Multicollinearity in predictor variables: A parameter gamma \\((\\gamma)\\) in simulation controls the exponential decline of eigenvalues \\((\\lambda_i, i = 1, \\ldots p)\\) corresponding to predictor variables as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_i = e^{-\\gamma(i-1)}, \\gamma &gt; 0 \\text{ and } i = 1, 2, \\ldots p \\tag{6} \\end{equation}\\] Two levels 0.2 and 0.8 of gamma are used for simulation so that level 0.2 simulates the data with low multicollinearity and 0.8 simulates the data with high multicollinearity. Position of relevant components: Initial principal components of a non-singular covariance matrix are larger than the later one. If the principal components corresponding to predictors with larger variation is not relevant for a response, this will just increase noise in the model. Here we will use two different levels of position index of predictor components: a) 1, 2, 3, 4 and b) 5, 6, 7, 8. Predictor components irrelevant for a response makes prediction difficult (Helland and Almøy 1994). When combined with multicollinearity, this factor can create both easy and difficult model for both estimation and prediction. Correlation in response variables: Many estimators also uses the structure of response for their estimation. Here the correlation between the responses are varied through a simulation parameter eta \\((\\eta)\\). The parameter controls the exponential decline of eigenvalues \\(\\kappa_j, j = 1, \\ldots m (\\text{ number of responses})\\) corresponding to response variables as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\eta_i = e^{-\\kappa(j-1)}, \\kappa &gt; 0 \\text{ and } j = 1, 2, \\ldots m \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] Four levels 0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 of eta are used in the so that level 0 simulates the data with uncorrelated response variables while 1.2 simulates the highly correlated response variables. Figure 2: Experimental Design of simulation parameters. Each point represents an unique data property. Here we have assumed that there is only one informative response component. In the final dataset, all predictors together span the same space as the relevant predictor components and all response together span the same space as the one informative response component. In addition, coefficient of determination is fixed at 0.8 for all dataset. A complete factorial design is adopted using different levels of factors discussed above to create 32 design (Figure 2) each of which gives dataset with unique properties. From each of these design and each estimation method, 50 different datasets are simulated so that each of them have same true population structure. In total, \\(5 \\times 32 \\times 50\\) i.e., 8000 datasets are simulated. Figure 3: Covariance between predictor components and response variables in population (top) and in the simulated data (bottom) for four different designs. The Bar in the background represents the variance of corresponding components. The simulation properties are directly reflected in the simulated data. For example, in Figure 3, design pairs 1 and 4 as well as 6 and 9 differs their properties only in terms of relevant predictor components while the design pairs 1 and 6 as well as 14 and 9 differs only in-terms of level of multicollinearity. The properties in population are also reflected in the simulated samples. "],
["basis-of-comparison.html", "Basis of Comparison Data Preparation", " Basis of Comparison The focus of this study is to extend the exploration of Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019) to compare the estimative performance of PCR, PLS1, PLS2, Xenv and Senv methods. The performance is measured on the basis of, average estimation error of the method using arbitrary number of components average number of components used by the methods to give minimum estimation error Let us define the expected estimation error as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{EE}_{ijkl} = \\mathsf{E}{\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{ij} - \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}_{ijkl}}\\right)^t \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{ij} - \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}_{ijkl}}\\right)\\right]} \\tag{8} \\end{equation}\\] for response \\(j = 1, \\ldots 4\\) in a given design \\(i=1, 2, \\ldots 32\\) and method \\(k=1(PCR), \\ldots 5(Senv)\\) using \\(l=0, \\ldots 10\\) number of components. Since both the expectation and the variance of \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) are unknown, the prediction error are estimated using data from 50 replications as follows, \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\mathcal{EE}_{ijkl}} = \\frac{1}{50}\\sum_{r=0}^{50}{\\left[\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{ij} - \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}_{ijklr}}\\right)^t \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{ij} - \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}_{ijklr}}\\right)\\right]} \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\widehat{\\mathcal{EE}_{ijkl}}\\) is the estimated prediction error averaged over \\(r=50\\) replicates. Data Preparation The dataset for further analysis consists of a) 32 designs created by the factors related to simulation parameters, b) 5 estimation methods, c) 11 (0-10) number of components, d) 50 replicates and e) 4 estimation error corresponding to each response computed as, \\[\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{EE}_\\circ}\\right) = \\left(\\beta - \\hat{\\beta}\\right)^t\\left(\\beta - \\hat{\\beta}\\right)\\] In addition, we will also refer to the results of prediction error in Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019). Our discussion revolves around, a) minimum estimation error corresponds to Error Dataset and b) number of average components used by them to obtain the minimum estimation error Component Dataset for every estimation methods. Error Dataset: For a given estimation method, design, and response, the component that gives the minimum of estimation error averaged over all replicates is selected as, \\[\\begin{equation} l_\\circ = \\operatorname*{argmin}_{l}\\left[\\frac{1}{50}\\sum_{i=1}^{50}{\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{EE}}_\\circ\\right)_{i}}\\right] \\end{equation}\\] The estimation error \\(\\widehat{\\mathcal{EE}}_\\circ\\) for every methods, design and response corresponding to \\(l_\\circ\\) component is then regarded as error dataset in the subsequent analysis. Let \\(\\mathbf{u}_{8000\\times4}=(u_j)\\) for \\(j = 1, \\ldots 4\\) be the outcome variables measuring the estimation error corresponding to the response \\(j\\) in the context of this dataset.

["exploration.html", "Exploration", " Exploration This section explores the variation in the error dataset and the component dataset for which we have used Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Let \\(t_u\\) and \\(t_v\\) be the principal component score sets corresponding to PCA run on the \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) matrices respectively. The scores density in Figure 4 and Figure 5 correspond to the first principal component of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), i.e. the first column of \\(t_u\\) and \\(t_v\\) respectively. Figure 4: Scores density corresponding to first principal component of error dataset (\\(\\mathbf{u}\\)) subdivided by methods, gamma and eta and grouped by relpos. The plot shows a clear difference between the effect of low and high multicollinearity in estimation error. In the case of low multicollinearity (gamma: 0.2), the estimation errors are smaller and have lesser variation compared to high multicollinearity (gamma: 0.9). High multicollinearity has a larger influence on all but noticeably in the methods based on envelopes. Some large estimation error in the envelope is more than 100 which in the case of other methods is less than 60. Furthermore, the relevant predictor components, in general, has a noticeable effect on estimation error. When relevant predictors are at position 5, 6, 7, 8, the predictor components at 1, 2, 3, 4, which carry most of the variation, becomes irrelevant. These irrelevant components with large variation add noise to the model and consequently increases the estimation error. The effect intensifies on highly collinear predictors. Designs with high multicollinearity and relevant predictors at position 5, 6, 7, 8 are relatively difficult to model for all the methods. Although these difficult designs have a large effect on estimation error, their effect on prediction error is less influential (Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø 2019). In the case of the component dataset (Figure Above), PCR, PLS1 and PLS2 methods have used more components in the case of high multicollinearity compared to low. Surprisingly, the envelope methods (Senv and Xenv) mostly have used a distinctly lesser number of components in both the cases of multicollinearity compared to other methods. The plot also shows that there is no clear effect due to the correlation of response variable on the number of components used to obtain minimum estimation error. Figure 5: Score density corresponding to first principal component of component dataset (\\(\\mathbf{v}\\)) subdivided by methods, gamma and eta and grouped by relpos. A clear interaction between the position of relevant predictors and the multicollinearity visible in the plot suggest that the methods use a larger number of components when the relevant components are at position 5, 6, 7, 8. Additionally, the use of components escalate and the difference between the two levels of relpos becomes wider in the case of high multicollinearity in the model. Such performance is also seen the the case of prediction error (See Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019)) however the number of components used in that case is lesser than in this case. Envelope methods, however, have shown a distinct result in contrast to the other methods. Even when the relevant predictors are at position 5, 6, 7, 8, the envelope methods, in contrast to other methods, have used an almost similar number of components as in the case of relevant predictor at position 1, 2, 3, 4. This shows that the envelope methods identify the predictor space relevant to the response differently and with few numbers of latent components. Following section explore the prediction and estimation error together with the regression coefficient of Simultaneous Envelope and Partial Least Squares for a design having high multicollinearity with predictor components at position 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we will use design with \\(n&gt;p\\) and no correlation between the response which corresponds to Design-9. Figure 6: Regression Coefficients estimated by PLS2 and Simultaneous methods on the data based on Design 9. Figure 7 shows a clear distinction between the modelling approach of PLS2 and Senv methods for the same model based on Design 9. In the case of PLS2, both minimum prediction error and minimum estimation error are obtained using seven to eight components and the estimated regression coefficients approximate the true coefficients. In contrast, the Senv method has approached the minimum prediction and minimum estimation error using one to two components and the corresponding estimated regression coefficients approximate the true coefficients (Figure 6). Despite having contrast modelling result for a dataset with similar properties, the minimum errors produced by them are comparable (See Table 1). Figure 7: Minimum prediction and estimation error for PLS2 and Simultaneous methods. The point and lines are averaged over 50 replications. The Figure 7 also shows that Senv has resulted in huge estimation error when the number of components is not optimal. This is also true for the PLS2 model however the extent of this variation is noticeably large in the Senv method. A similar observation as Senv is also found in Xenv method while PCR and PLS1 are closer to the PLS2 in terms of their use of components in order to produce the minimum error (See Table 1).

["analysis.html", "Analysis Effect Analysis of the Error Model Effect Analysis of the Component Model", " Analysis A statistical analysis using Multivariate Analysis of variance (MANOVA) model is performed on error dataset and component dataset in order to understand the association between data properties and the estimation methods. Let the corresponding models be error model (10) and component model (11). In the model, we will consider the interaction of simulation parameters (p, gamma, eta, and relpos) and Method The model is fitted using corresponding error dataset (\\(\\mathbf{u}\\)) and component dataset (\\(\\mathbf{v}\\)). Error Model: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{u} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + (\\texttt{p} + \\texttt{gamma} + \\texttt{eta} + \\texttt{relpos} + \\texttt{Methods})^3 + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] Component Model: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{v} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + (\\texttt{p} + \\texttt{gamma} + \\texttt{eta} + \\texttt{relpos} + \\texttt{Methods})^3 + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) corresponds to the estimation errors in error dataset and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) corresponds to the number of components used by a method to obtain minimum estimation error in the component dataset. To make the analysis equivalent to Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019), we have also used Pillai’s trace statistic for accessing the result of MANOVA. Figure 8 plots the Pillai’s trace statistics as bars with corresponding F-values as text labels. The left plot corresponds to the error model and the right plot corresponds to the component model. Figure 8: Pillai Statistic and F-value for the MANOVA model. The bar represents the Pillai Statistic and the text labels are F-value for corresponding factor. Error Model: Unlike prediction error in Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019), Method has a lesser effect while the amount of multicollinearity controlled by gamma parameter has a huge effect in the case of estimation error (Figure 8). In addition, the position of relevant predictors and its interaction with the gamma parameters also have a substantial effect on the estimation error. This also supports the results seen in the Exploration section where relevant predictors at position 5, 6, 7, 8 with high multicollinearity design creates large uninformative variance in the components 1, 2, 3, 4 making the design difficult. The effect of this on the estimation error is much larger than on the prediction error. Furthermore, the eta factor controlling the correlation between the responses, and its second-order interaction with other factors except for the number of predictors is significant. The effect is also comparable with the main effect of Method and eta. Component Model: Although the Method does not have a large impact on the estimation error, the component model in Figure 8 (right) shows that the methods are significantly different and has a huge effect on the number of components they use to obtain the minimum estimation error. The result also corresponds to the case of prediction error in Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø (2019). However, the F-value corresponding the relpos and gamma shows that the significance of these factors are much stronger compared to the case of prediction error. We will further explore the effects of individual levels of different factors in the following subsection. Effect Analysis of the Error Model In figure 9 (left), the effect of correlation between the responses controlled by eta parameter has a clear influence on the estimation error and the effect is highly dependent on the estimation methods. In the case of envelope methods, the effect of eta on estimation error is smaller than other methods and are similar in the case of both levels of the position of relevant predictors (relpos). However, PCR, PLS1 and PLS2 have shown a clear difference in the estimation error for four different levels of response correlation. The error in the case of relevant predictors at position 5, 6, 7, 8 is huge as compared to the case where relevant predictors are at position 1, 2, 3, 4. Among these methods, PLS1 has the highest estimation error in both levels of relevant predictors since the method models the response variables independently and does not consider the correlation structure in them. Figure 9: Effect plot of some interactions of the multivariate linear model of estimation error Figure 9 (right) shows the large difference in the effect of two levels of the position of relevant predictors especially in the designs with high multicollinearity. In the case of high multicollinearity, all methods have noticeable poor performance compared to the case of low multicollinearity. Figure 9 also shows that PCR and PLS2 methods have the smallest effect on the estimation error in both levels of relevant predictors in the case of moderate to high level of correlation present in the response. In the case of low correlation, envelope methods have the smallest estimation error. Similarly, the designs with low multicollinearity are favourable to the envelope methods. Their estimation errors in these cases are smaller than other methods. Effect Analysis of the Component Model In the case of component model, envelope methods are the clear winner in almost all designs. In the case of low multicollinearity and position of relevant predictors at 1, 2, 3, 4, PLS1 has obtained the minimum estimation error similar to the envelope methods, however in the case of high multicollinearity PLS1 has also used a fairly large number of components to obtain the minimum prediction error. It is interesting to observe that the envelope methods have comparable and minimum estimation error in most of the designs have used 1-2 components on average. The effect of the correlation in the response has minimal effect on the number of components used by the methods. The design nine which we have considered in the previous section has minimum estimation error from envelope methods using at most 2 components by Xenv and 3 components by Senv. This corresponds with the results seen in Figure 10. Figure 10: Effect plot of some interactions of the multivariate linear model of number of components to get minimum prediction error "],
