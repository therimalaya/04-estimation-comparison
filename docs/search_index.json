High error in estimation not necessarily results in high prediction error but can lead to an unreliable prediction when test data are in a different direction than the training data. In addition, the effect of a variable becomes unstable and can not be interpreted in such situations. Many research fields are more interested in these estimates than performing prediction. This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and well-established (PLS, PCR) prediction methods using simulated data with specifically designed properties such as multicollinearity, the correlation between multiple responses and position of principal components of predictor that are relevant for the response. This study aims to give some insight into these methods and help the researcher to understand and use them for further study. Write some specifics from the results to show what we have found. Introduction Estimation of parameters in a regression model is an integral part of many research study. Research fields such as social science, econometrics, psychology and medical study are more interested in measuring the impact of certain indicator or variable rather than performing prediction. Such studies have a large influence on people’s perception and also help in policy making and decisions. Technology has facilitated researcher to collect a large amount of data however often times, such data either contains irrelevant information or are highly collinear. Researchers are devising new estimators to extract information and identify their inter-relationship. Some estimators are robust towards fixing the multicollinearity problem while some are targeted to model only the relevant information contained in the response variable. This study extends the (Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø 2019) and compares some well-established estimators such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares (PLS) together with two new methods based on envelope estimation: Envelope estimation in predictor space (Xenv) (R Dennis Cook, Li, and Chiaromonte 2010) and simultaneous estimation of envelope (Senv) (R. Dennis Cook and Zhang 2015). The estimation process of these methods is discussed in [Methods] section. The comparison tests the estimation performance of these methods using multi-response simulated data from a linear model with controlled properties. The properties include the number of predictors, level of multicollinearity, the correlation between different response variables and the position of relevant predictor components. These properties are explained in Experimental Design section together with the strategy behind the simulation and data model. References "],

["estimation-methods.html", "Estimation Methods Principal Components Regression Partial Least Squares Regression Envelope Estimations", " Estimation Methods A regression model is written as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\underset{(1\\times m)}{\\mathbf{y}} = \\underset{(1\\times p)(p\\times m)} {\\mathbf{x}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} + \\underset{(1 \\times m)}{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is a vector of \\(m\\) responses measured about their means, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a vector of \\(p\\) predictors measured about their means, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a matrix of regression coefficients and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) is a vector of independent error terms with constant variance \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{y|x}\\). In ordinary least squares, coefficient \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is estimated as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\underset{(p\\times m)}{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}} = \\left(\\underset{(p\\times n)}{\\mathbf{x}^t} \\underset{(n\\times p)}{\\mathbf{x}}\\right)^{-1} \\underset{(p \\times n)(n \\times m)}{\\mathbf{x}^t\\mathbf{y}} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] Principal Components Regression Principal Components are new set of variables from the transformation of original dataset such that they are uncorrelated with each other and the variation in the original data are ordered from first to last of these new variables. Let us define a transformation of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\underset{(1\\times p)}{\\mathbf{x}} = \\underset{(1 \\times k)}{\\mathbf{z}} \\underset{(k \\times p)}{\\mathbf{R}^t} \\tag{3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is the eigenvectors corresponding to the covariance of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) are the principal components.

The regression coefficient of (4) can be estimated as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\underset{(k\\times m)}{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\alpha}}} = \\left(\\underset{(k \\times n)}{\\mathbf{z}^t} \\underset{(n \\times k)}{\\mathbf{z}}\\right)^{-1} \\underset{(k \\times n)(n \\times m)}{\\mathbf{z}^t\\mathbf{y}} \\tag{5} \\end{equation}\\] Using (3) in (2), we get, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\underset{(p\\times m)}{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}} = \\left[ \\underset{(p\\times k)(k \\times n)}{\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{z}^t} \\underset{(n\\times k)(k \\times p)}{\\mathbf{z} \\mathbf{R}^t} \\right]^{-1} \\underset{(p\\times k)(k \\times n)}{\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{z}^t} \\underset{(n\\times m)}{y} \\end{aligned} \\] Partial Least Squares Regression How beta coefficients are constructed How it is dependent on the variance-covariance matrices In what way PLS1 and PLS2 differ Envelope Estimations How beta coefficients are constructed How it is dependent on the variance-covariance matrices In what way Xenv and Senv differ "],
["experimental-design.html", "Experimental Design Basis of Comparison", " Experimental Design An R (R Core Team 2018) package simrel (Rimal, Almøy, and Sæbø 2018; Sæbø, Almøy, and Helland 2015) is used to simulate data. For the simulation the number of observation is kept fixed at \\(n = 100\\) and following four simulation parameters are used to obtain the data with wide range of properties. Number of predictors: In order to cover both tall \\((n&gt;p)\\) and wide \\((p&gt;n)\\) cases, \\(p=20\\) and \\(p=250\\) number of predictors are simulated. Multicollinearity in predictor variables: A parameter gamma \\((\\gamma)\\) in simulation controls the exponential decline of eigenvalues \\((\\lambda_i, i = 1, \\ldots p)\\) corresponding to predictor variables as, \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda_i = e^{-\\gamma(i-1)}, \\gamma &gt; 0 \\text{ and } i = 1, 2, \\ldots p \\tag{6} \\end{equation}\\] Two levels 0.2 and 0.8 of gamma are used for simulation so that level 0.2 simulates the data with low multicollinearity and 0.8 simulates the data with high multicollinearity. Position of relevant components: Initial principal components of a non-singular covariance matrix are larger than the later one. If the principal components corresponding to predictors with larger variation is not relevant for a response, this will just increase noise in the model. Here we will use two different levels of position index of predictor components: a) 1, 2, 3, 4 and b) 5, 6, 7, 8. Predictor components irrelevant for a response makes prediction difficult (Helland and Almøy 1994). When combined with multicollinearity, this factor can create both easy and difficult model for both estimation and prediction. Figure 1: Experimental Design of simulation parameters. Each point represents an unique data property.
