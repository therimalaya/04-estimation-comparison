# Discussion and Conclusion

The overall performance of methods highly depends on the nature of the data. The MANOVA plot shows that most of the simulation parameters except `p` has significant interaction with methods. In addition, the high interaction of `gamma` and the `relpos` suggest to estimate or identify the relevant predictor components in the case of highly multicollinearity data before any analysis. Although the interaction does not have this extent of influence in prediction, one should be careful about interpreting the estimates.

Designs with low multicollinearity and independent responses are in favour of envelope methods. The methods have produced the smallest prediction and estimation error with significantly few numbers of components in these designs. However, as the correlation in the responses increases, the estimation error in envelope methods in most cases also increases noticeably. Despite the interaction of the `eta` parameter with the method is significant, the extent of its effect is rather small compared to both main and interaction effect of `gamma` and `relpos`. 

The effect of the number of variables is negligible in all cases for all designs. Here the use of principal components for reducing the dimension of $n<p$ designs, as in prediction paper, has been useful so that we were able to model using envelope methods without losing much variation in the data.

Both prediction and estimation corresponding to PCR methods are found to be stable even when the non-optimal number of components are used. The PLS1 method is in general performed poorer than other methods. Unlike in prediction comparison, the performance of envelope methods in this comparison is not impressive except the use of the number of components to get the minimum estimation error. The envelope methods have used 1-2 number of components in almost all designs which are quite impressive. However, non-optimal number of components can lead to large estimation error so one should be careful in this respect while using the envelope methods. Both PLS1 and PLS2 uses less number of components when the relevant components are at position 1, 2, 3, 4. However, both methods used 7-8 components for the designs with relevant components at position 5, 6, 7, 8.

We expect the results from this study helps researchers, working on theory, application and modelling, to understand these methods and their performance on various nature of the data. Based on the performance of envelope methods in these two studies, we would like to encourage readers to consider using new methods such as envelope for their research and analysis.

The first part of this study [@rimal2019pred] on prediction comparison should be considered to obtain a comprehensive view of this comparison. A shiny [@shiny] web application at [http://therimalaya.shinyapps.io/Comparison](http://therimalaya.shinyapps.io/Comparison) allows readers to explore all the visualizations for both prediction and estimation comparisons. In addition, a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/therimalaya/04-estimation-comparison](https://github.com/therimalaya/04-estimation-comparison) can be used to reproduce this study.
